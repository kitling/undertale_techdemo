# undertale_techdemo

We'll see how long this lasts, but for now, I'm making additions to this.

Undertale Techdemo for 3DS

Made with ctrulib, sf2dlib, sftdlib, sfillib, libogg, Tremor, and some sound examples written by MerryMage.

All code under the source directory (not recursively!) is licenced under the zlib licence, contained in ZLIB, except parts of main.c, because of not being able to ask the original author what licence they would like. :/

I do not own Undertale. All resources and sounds from Undertale by Toby Fox and are copyrighted by him.

NOTE: To make this demo to work correctly, copy these files:

- undertale_techdemo.3dsx
- undertale_techdemo.smdh
- everything under the 'romfs' folder. The "sound", "tex", and "font" folders.

And place these files in a folder called "undertale_techdemo" (if you don't have it, create it on the "3ds" folder).

The eventual goal is to get it to take unmodified files from the actual game and not be distributing modified versions of art/sound. For now, I'll include some assets in the actual releases for now. If you wish to grab the music files which are not on git, grab the Undertale Demo and grab house1.ogg. Though, hopefully all of the music in the demo will eventually be used.

If you get an error while compiling about there not being a rule to make 'ivorbisfile_example.o', just run make again. I would love to hear any solutions to this.

Binary releases come whenever I feel like it. Mainly, when some visible progress of some sort has been made.

A HUUUGE thanks for MerryMage for helping free my code from the curse of csnd. And to everyone who tolerated my stumbling.

I feel like I understand some things better now.
